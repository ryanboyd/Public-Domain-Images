# Public-Domain-Images
 Images that I have dedicated to the public domain
 Sometimes, I make images/figures for papers. These days, I try to put them into the public domain so that anyone can use them if they so desire.
 Any of the images that you find here can be used/redistributed in any way that you like. You don't need to ask for permission, you don't need to include credit for their reuse â€” they're just out there for anyone to use however they want.
